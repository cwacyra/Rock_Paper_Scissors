This is a web-cam based game that utilizes computer vision to create an interactive rock - paper - scissor game. By utilizing the OpenCV library within Processing3, this program tracks the color red on a controlling prop which in this case is a glove with red markers on it. For each gesture: rock, paper, and scissors, a number of dots are tracked based on blob tracking to convert these gestures into readible variables for the code to then use to play a game with the computer.

To Run:
1. Make sure a web-cam is either installed into your computer or plugged in
2. Equip your tracking glove 
3. Ensure the area of play is well lit and has a white background.
4. Run the processing sketch and enjoy
